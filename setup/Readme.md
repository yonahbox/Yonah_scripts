# Setup

Contains files to automate setup of aircraft, GCS and servers

More details on how to use these files can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/yonahbox/Yonah_ROS_packages/wiki/Software-Installation)

## List of files and folders

* **aws**: Setup files for Yonah's AWS Server
* **common**: Setup files that are common across aircraft and ground (this is a slight misnomer as it doesn't actually include server, hence is not really "common")
* **bone_setup.sh**: Setup file for aircraft's Single-Board Computer (Beaglebone; hence the name bone_setup!)
* **clone_setup.sh**: Setup file for aircraft if the OS was cloned from a previous aircraft
* **gcs_setup.sh**: Setup file for ground control station
